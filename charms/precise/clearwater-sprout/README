# Overview

This charm supports deployment and scaling of the Sprout component of a Project Clearwater system.  See http://www.projectclearwater.org for details of Project Clearwater.

# Usage

The Sprout service can be deployed by creating a suitable config.yaml file then running

    juju deploy --config config.yaml clearwater-sprout
    juju add-relation clearwater-sprout <dns-service>

The only currently supported DNS service for Clearwater is clearwater-route53 (when deploying in Amazon EC2).  Additional DNS services will be added for other environments in future.

The Sprout configuration file takes the following format.

clearwater-sprout:
  reg_min_expires: 400
  session_max_expires: 900
  repo: http://repo.cw-ngv.com/stable

## Scale out Usage

## Known Limitations and Issues

clearwater-sprout currently only supports running as a single unit.  Clustering support will be released shortly, which will allow units to be added to and removed from a clearwater-sprout deployment using juju add-unit and juju remove-unit commandas.
