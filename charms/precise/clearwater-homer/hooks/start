# This hook needs to be idempotent, so this could be run when homer is
# already running, when it's running but not monitored by monit, when
# it's stopped but being monitored (so it's about to start), or stopped
# and unmonitored. To cover all these cases, stop monit, start homer, start
# monit, then finally have monit monitor homer
service clearwater-monit stop
